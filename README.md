# Neural Networks
Multi-layer Perceptron
Performed data classification using MLP neural networks. The correction was made using different learning rates (constant, invscaling, adaptive)

Recurrent Neural Network
For the selected data set, regression and prediction were performed for 6 combinations. The original dataset was compared with the data for verification.
